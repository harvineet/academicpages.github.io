In email marketing, it is typical to observe moderate to very low open rates among customers. We consider the problem of predicting whether a customer will open an email and how much time will be taken for opening the email. Survival analysis offers a framework to model time to event data where event in our case corresponds to an email being opened. A mixture model based approach is used that accounts for the low open rate characteristic of email data.
