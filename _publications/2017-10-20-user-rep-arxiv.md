There is significant interest amongst AI community in learning representations of network data which can be used for tasks such as inferring properties of entities within the network. Prominent application domains include social networks, knowledge bases and biological interaction networks. We propose a method to learn representations of users in social networks from the activity traces of users. Current techniques rely on the underlying network structure for learning such representations, which might not be known reliably. The proposed technique can be used to extract features for prediction tasks in social networks such as link prediction.
