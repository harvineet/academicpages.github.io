Past work focussed on predicting memorability of images and there is limited work on video memorability. We design a user study for collecting video recall data and develop a predictor for memorability based on video features such as motion, color, saliency and semantics. Experiments demonstrate the use of the predictor for creating memorable summaries of user-generated video content.
