Changes in network structure during the spread of the topic has been found to be predictive of its eventual reach. We investigate new network-based features such as conductance of topic sub-graph for the task of predicting virality of a hashtag in Twitter. We find that the proposed set of features significantly outperform earlier work. This provides further evidence and motivation to study graph-theoretic properties such as conductance of topic sub-graphs in understanding future spread of the topics.
